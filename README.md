## Description

This website is a personal professional portfolio to showcase various HTML and CSS skills. I focused on using semantic elements for file readability, reactive elements, flexbox elements, and more. The website has functional links to navigate the page, view my previous work, or contact me via email and phone.

The website was also laid out to accommodate large and small screen sizes for desktop and mobile viewing.
